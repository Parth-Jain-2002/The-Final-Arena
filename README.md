# Multiplayer-FPS-Shooter

We all have played PUBG, Free Fire and other Battle Royale Games in our free time. Whenever I played them, a thought always delved in my mind, can I someday make something similiar to this? Can I make a basic version of PUBG? The base of such games resides in their multiplayer shooting levels.

Hence when I started exploring game dev, I always longed to make one such game. _And finally, I have made a basic version of that big dream._ **This is still an ongoing project and I will continue to add new game elements to this periodically.**

***This is made using Unity Game Engine and Photon Server for multiplayer capabilites.***

## _Game Instructions_
- Move around by pressing arrow keys _(Horizontal Movement of the Player)_
- Move the player head by using the mouse for looking around and up and down. _(Movement of the Player Eyes)_
- For sprinting, you have to press the left shift or right shift key. While sprinting, your field of view changes to make it look more realistic
- The main element of any FPS game is the weapons. Presently, there are 2 guns in the game. First one is a pistol, which is manual and the other one is a machine gun, which is automatic. To make the game look realistic, it has sway and recoil on it.
- For jumping, you have to press Spacebar and to equip machine gun, press 1 and for pistol, press 2.
- On the bottom left of the screen, there is the health bar which indicates your remaining health.
- If it reaches zero, you will respawn again and can continue the game forward

> This clip shows the gun and its effect. There are 2 guns presently: A Pistol and A Machine Gun. You can also aim the gun using left mouse button. If you observe closely, the gun moves a little slowly while moving left to right or top to bottom. This is because of swaying effect, added to make it look more realistic. Whenever bullet is fired, the gun recoils. Even when you are on rest, gun moves slightly. This happens due to breathing of the player, added to make the game close to real life.
